CSS is already W3C validated.

- To change background or to add a logo, go to the Dashboard -> Appearance.

- When using a custom background image, it would be advisable to use a custom logo as well.

- Make sure to set a navigation menu after installation.

- For featured images in existing posts, you may have to download the 'Regenerate Thumbnails' plugin from WordPress.org, then run it to resize all existing thumbnails to the theme's default sizes.

- Youtube frames will be resized in widgets area however height will be set to auto. You will have to set height manually when pasting the embed code in text area e.g. height="150".  The same applies to large images as well.
